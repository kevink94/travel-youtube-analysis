with data and then further discuss insights based on what was
discovered.

### Who is this project intended for?

  - Content Creators / Marketing Agencies who want to better understand
    their audience and tailor their content effectively
  - Data Science enthusiasts, as they might get new ideas other peopleâ€™s analyses (for intermediates)
  - those generally interested in Travel YouTubers

## Key Insights:

- The more likes and comments a video has, the more views the video gets (it is not guaranteed that this is a causal relationship, it is simply a correlation and can work both way).
